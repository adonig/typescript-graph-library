# TypeScript Graph Theory

I had to calculate a shortest path, so I wrote this little TypeScript graph theory library inspired by [JGraphT](https://jgrapht.org/).

Used [alexjoverm](https://github.com/alexjoverm)'s awesome [typescript-library-starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter).
